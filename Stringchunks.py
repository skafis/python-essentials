#a function that takes a string and a positive integer n, splits the string into parts of n length and returns them in an array. It is ok for the last element to have less characters than n.
#If n is not a valid size(> 0) (or is absent), you should return an empty array.
#If n is greater than the lenght of the string, you should return an array with the only element being the same string.
